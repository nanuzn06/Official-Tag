For getting an Official Rom and Maintaining your device :)

Requirements for the Official Device Maintainership:-

1. You should have a proper knowledge of Github & Gerrit (A bit :p)
2. You should also have a Telegram Account so as to keep in touch with you.
3. You have to maintain a good commit history with proper maintained authorship to the required commits.
4. We don't support kanging so if you're gonna maintain your device with kang then better stay away from this :)

Device Requirements:-

1. Device main functions should be working (camera, data, video calling, wifi Hotspot, etc) so as to be used as a good daily driver.
2. All the device sources should be opensource.
3. All the device sources like device tree/vendor tree/common-tree should be uploaded in our Lean-Devices org.
